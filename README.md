# Titanic Survival Predictor – Naive Bayes & KNN (FSM Internship Task)

This project implements two supervised learning models — **Naive Bayes** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Features Used
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- FamilySize (SibSp + Parch)

## Algorithms
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (k=3,5,7)

## Results
| Model       | Accuracy |
|-------------|----------|
| Naive Bayes | 91.39%   |
| KNN (k=7)   | 88.04%   |
